The user interface
==================

The user interface consists of a menu bar, a tool bar, and three main widgets. The center and one
of the main widgets of the interface is the diagram. Here different components can be placed and
connected. The available components can be found in the widget on the lefthand side and can simply
be dragged into the diagram to be placed. On the righthand widget the file tree of the ``ddck``-
folder can be seen. For each component dropped into the diagram an additional folder is created in
this tree.
