** Details: 
** A zero capacitance sensible heat exchanger is modeled in various configurations. In this instance, a counter flow
** heat exchanger is modeled. Given the hot and cold side inlet temperatures and flow rates, the effectiveness is
** calculated for a given fixed value of the overall heat transfer coefficient.
