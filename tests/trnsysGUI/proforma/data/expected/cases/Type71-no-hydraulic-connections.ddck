** Description: 
** Solar Collector; Evacuated Tube
************************************************************************************************************************

************************************************************************************************************************
** Details: 
** Because the Solar Ratings and Certification Commission (SRCC) defines the efficiency of an evacuated tube collector
** bank using the same equations as those for a flat plat, the main difference (from a modeling point of view) between
** an evacuated tube collector and a flat plate collector is in the treatment of incidence angle modifiers (IAMs). Type
** 71 is therefore based on the Type 1 code with the major difference being that Type 71 reads a text file containing a
** list of transverse and longitudinal IAMs. This component models the thermal performance of a variety of an evacuated
** tube collector types using theory. The total collector array may consist of collectors connected in series and in
** parallel. The thermal performance of the total collector array is determined by the number of modules in series and
** the characteristics of each module. The user must provide results from standard tests of efficiency versus a ratio of
** fluid temperature minus ambient temperature to radiation (DT/IT). The fluid temperature may be an inlet, average, or
** outlet temperature. The model assumes that the efficiency vs. DT/IT curve can be modeled as a quadratic equation.
** (Changed from version 13 where efficiency vs. DT/IT was assumed linear.) Corrections are applied to the slope,
** intercept, and curvature parameters to account for identical collectors in series, and flow rates other than those at
** test conditions. The effects of off-normal solar incidence are modeled by the provision of a bi-axial incidence angle
** modifier data file.

** used to specify how many collectors are hooked up in a series arrangement where the output of the first collector is
** the inlet to the second collector. NOTE: increasing this value does not change the array area. Total array area is
** set by parameter 2

** and not net area).

4.19 ! 3: Fluid specific heat [kJ/kg.K] ([0.0,+Inf])

** The collector efficiency equation can be written as a function of the inlet, average or outlet temperature. Specify 1
